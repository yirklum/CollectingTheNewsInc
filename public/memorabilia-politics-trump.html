					On November 8, 2016, Republican Donald Trump stunned the political world by defeating Democratic candidate Hillary 
					Clinton to become the 45th President of the United States. He lost the popular vote, but won the all-important 
					Electoral College vote. During his first week in office, Trump issued executive orders trying to repeal the Affordable 
					Care Act and withdraw from the Trans Pacific Partnership. He also announced plans to build a wall along the Southern 
					border between Mexico and the U.S. A month after entering office, Trump started his re-election bid. The president 
					successfully nominated Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. In June of 2017, Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Paris 
					Climate Agreement. In April of 2018, the administration began a “zero tolerance” immigration policy and started to 
					separate families at the Southern border. After many protests and the separation of more than 2,300 children from their 
					parents, the program was halted in June of 2018. Trump authorized military action in Syria, increased troop strength in 
					Afghanistan, approved a $110 billion arms deal with Saudi Arabia, and, in May of 2017, backed out of the Iran nuclear 
					deal. On Dec. 6, 2017, President Trump recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. He also initiated a trade war with 
					China in January 2018, by imposing tariffs. Between June of 2018 and June of 2019, President Trump and North Korean 
					Chairman Kim Jong-un held three summits dealing with denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. So far, talks have been 
					unsuccessful. Trump has had several meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin, including the July 16, 2018 summit 
					in Helsinki, Finland, where the U.S. president said he didn’t believe the Russians had interfered in the 2016 U.S. 
					elections, contrary to what his own intelligence agencies had told him. By the end of July 2018, 61% of Trump’s senior 
					staffers had left his administration. According to the Washington Post, Trump had publicly told over 12,000 lies while 
					in office. Twenty-two women have come forward with charges of sexual misconduct and there are currently 29 open 
					investigations into the Trump administration. Donald Trump is the least popular president in the history of presidential 
					polling.
