					Capitalizing on President Ronald Reagan’s popularity, Vice President George H.W. Bush ran for office and became the 41st President in 1988, 
					with Indiana Senator Dan Quayle as his vice president. Budget deficits leftover from the Reagan administration were a major problem for the 
					incoming policy makers. Bush broke a campaign pledge and raised taxes. His foreign policy decisions included military action in Panama, 
					followed by a much larger operation, the Gulf War. He felt the war presented an opportunity for a new world order. There were also major 
					events that changed the world’s political landscape. 1n 1989, the Berlin wall came down and, in December 26,1991, the Soviet Union dissolved. 
					Bush’s military successes helped his popularity soared to 89%, a record high. He also appointed two Supreme Court justices during his time in 
					office. Despite his successes, the President’s polling numbers declined significantly due to an ailing economy, high unemployment numbers and 
					his broken pledge not to increase taxes. All those factors helped a young governor of Arkansas, Bill Clinton, capture the presidency in 1992. 
					Just prior to leaving office President Bush pardoned six senior White House officials who had been involved in the Iran/Contra affair during 
					the Reagan years.

							February 5, 1992, President George H.W. Bush visited the National Grocers Association in Orlando, Florida. Some reports indicated the 
							president was “amazed” by the technology and implied he was out of touch with the public. Others have denied the implication.

							The most remembered line from George Bush’s acceptance speech at the 1988 RNC was, “Read my lips…no new taxes!”. During his bid for re-election, 
							those words came back to haunt him. He had to compromise with a democratically controlled congress in 1990 and raised taxes to reduce the 
							budget deficit. His competitors claimed that made him untrustworthy. (Credit: CNN)
