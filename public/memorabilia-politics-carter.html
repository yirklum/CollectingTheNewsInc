					Jimmy Carter was sworn in as the 39th President of the United States on January 20, 1977. He became President by defeating 
					President Gerald Ford in a close election, capturing 51% of the popular vote and gaining 297 electoral votes to Ford’s 240. 
					Carter, the former Governor of Georgia, beat out Senator Ted Kennedy for the Democratic nomination during the 1976 Presidential 
					campaign. Despite being an incumbent President, Ford was burdened by his administration’s loss in South Vietnam, a poor economy 
					and his pardon of Richard Nixon. Carter had promised more integrity in government and, along with his Vice-Presidential pick, 
					Walter Mondale, had campaigned on the theme of honesty, promising, “I’ll never tell a lie.” His successful bid for the Presidency 
					came with a Democratic majority in the House and Senate.
				</p>
					<p>
					Despite his majorities in both houses, President Carter was unable to pass his legislation on welfare reform or the long-range energy 
					reform his administration strongly supported. He was successful, however, in securing treaties with Panama in 1977 and brokering the 
					famous Camp David Accords in 1978 between Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin. He also re-opened 
					diplomatic relations between the U.S. and China, while breaking ties with Taiwan, and got a SALT II treaty signed with the Soviets. 
					</p>
					<p>
					The Carter administration faced a poor economy and a “crisis of confidence” or what some called a national malaise. The biggest challenge 
					occurred on November 4, 1979, when Iranian students laid siege to the American Embassy in Tehran, taking 52 hostages in the process. The 
					students were demanding the return of the Shah of Iran who had been overthrown and was in the United States for cancer treatment. Carter 
					refused, and the hostages were held captive for 444 days. President Carter would later blame the hostage crisis for his failure to win a 
					second term as President. The hostages were releases just after Ronald Reagan was inaugurated the 40th U.S. President on January 20, 1981.
