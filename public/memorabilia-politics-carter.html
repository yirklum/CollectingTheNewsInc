					Jimmy Carter was sworn in as the 39th president of the United States on January 20, 1977. He became president by defeating incumbent Gerald Ford in a very close election. Carter had promised more integrity in government and, along with his vice-presidential pick, Walter Mondale, had campaigned on the theme of honesty, promising, “I’ll never tell a lie.” His greatest political success in office was brokering the famous Camp David Accords in 1978 between Egyptian president Anwar Sadat and Israeli prime minister Menachem Begin. He also re-opened diplomatic relations between the U.S. and China, while breaking ties with Taiwan, and got a SALT II treaty signed with the Soviets. His biggest challenge occurred on November 4, 1979, when Iranian students laid siege to the American Embassy in Tehran, taking 52 hostages in the process. The hostages were held captive for 444 days. President Carter would later blame the hostage crisis for his failure to win a second term as president. The hostages were releases just after Ronald Reagan was inaugurated as the 40th U.S. president on January 20, 1981.
