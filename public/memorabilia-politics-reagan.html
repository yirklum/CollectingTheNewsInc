					As the Reagan Era began on January, 20, 1981, Iranian officials released the 52 American hostages that had been held for 444 days in Tehran, Iran. 
					A month earlier, President Ronald Reagan had won a landslide victory over incumbent president Jimmy Carter. The new administration favored 
					supply-side economics, policies that became known as Reaganomics. Reagan began his presidency as an ardent anti-communist, funding a missile defense 
					system called Star Wars, to act as a shield against Soviet nuclear threat. As the Soviet Union began to dissolve, Reagan adjusted his approach and 
					sought a closer relationship with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. They were able to sign a historic arms control treaty. Immigration reform was passed 
					during his second term. During 8 years in office, President Reagan named four Supreme Court Justices, including the first woman appointed to the high 
					court. He also named 368 judges to U.S. District Courts and U.S. Courts of Appeals, more than any other president. He left office with a 68% approval 
					rating, matching that of Bill Clinton and Franklin Roosevelt.

							At the second presidential debate of the 1984 election cycle (October 21), a 73-year-old President Reagan famously dealt with a 
							question about age. He said, “I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent’s youth, and inexperience.”
