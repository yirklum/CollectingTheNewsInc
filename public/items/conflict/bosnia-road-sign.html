				<h2>City Center Road Sign</h2>
					
				<div class="item-pages">
					<img src="bosnia-road-sign.jpeg" alt="Caption" class="item-image">

					<p class="item-text"> 
						The Airport Road was one of the most dangerous stretches of land in Sarajevo during the war in Bosnia. 
						The road straddled front-line positions between Serb and Muslim forces. Known as the airport "sniper's alley", it was 
						the main road from the airport to the City Center. It was where ABC Producer David Caplan was shot and killed in July 1992. 
						Here is how the New York Times correspondent, John Burns, described it in September of 1992:
						<br><br>
							
						<span class="passage">"On the map, the trip across the lines of the Sarajevo siege doesn't look like much, just a quick journey 
							from the outer suburbs into the city center. In a rented Russian jeep, with jerry-cans of spare fuel making the vehicle into 
							a mobile Molotov cocktail, it is a passage through hell.
							<br><br>
							Blackened, burned-out houses set back 50 yards from the road, eerily still, serve as sniper hideouts. Driving flat out, with 
							windows closed and flak jackets pulled up around their necks, those making the trip can sometimes hear shots being fired and 
							mortars exploding. The litter of spent shell casings lie on the road, where there are gaping holes made by mortars, and the 
							blasted wrecks of tanks and trucks.
							<br><br>
							From the Serbian-held suburb of Ilidza to the relative sanctuary of the United Nations headquarters inside the Bosnian Government 
							lines, less than three miles away, takes only a few minutes, but most who make the dash will never forget it. Many spend hours or 
							days preparing, calculating the least hazardous moment, emblazoning their vehicles with flags and stickers identifying them as 
							foreigners, consulting with others who have made the journey or waiting for a United Nations military convoy to follow. But in the 
							end, it is a leap of hope."
						</span>
						
						<br><br>			
						The sign contains holes created by tank rounds as well as hundreds of bullet holes and shrapnel marks incurred during intense fighting 
						in the area. The sign was obtained by Bosniac soldiers adter hostilities in the area ended. The sign is currently on display at the 
						Newseum in Washington, DC.
