						This was part of a kit that was used in West Palm Beach, Florida, during the presidential election of 2000. 
						<br><br>
						The voting resulted in a virtual tie between Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Al Gore. The two candidates ended the 
						night with the Bush campaign ahead by an infinitesimal 1,787 votes out of six million cast. Under Florida law, if the margin 
						is within 0.5 percent, a machine recount is mandatory. That recount took place and the Bush lead dropped to 327 votes. 
						During the count, a large number of ballots were not included because the ballots could not be read by the tabulating 
						machines. Some of the paper ballots had not been punched all the way through and others had only been indented slightly. 
						They became famous as “hanging chad” and "pregnant chad” in the press. The Gore campaign requested hand recounts in four 
						counties that were traditionally supportive to Democrats. There were other issues with the ballots, but the Florida 
						Secretary of State, Katherine Harris, tried to certify the election by the statutory deadline of November 14. When the 
						recount wasn’t finished by that date, the Florida Supreme Court stepped in and enjoined the Secretary from certifying the 
						election and the recounts continued. 
						<br><br>
						Legal teams from both political parties filed some 50 individual lawsuits over the next month. On December 8, the Florida 
						Supreme Court ordered a state-wide manual recount. The following day, the U.S. Supreme Court weighed in and issued a stay 
						that stopped the recount. It heard oral arguments and then, on December 12, decided to reverse the lower court’s decision 
						and halted the recount. The high court ruled (7-2) that the recount violated the “equal protection” clause of the 
						constitution. It also decided (5-4) that the actions of the Florida Supreme Court had, in effect, created new election law, 
						and that was the duty for the state legislature. The majority of the justices also felt a recount could not be held in time 
						to select electors and meet the federal guidelines.
						<br><br>
						The court awarded Florida’s 25 Electoral votes to the Republicans and that gave George W. Bush enough electoral votes 
						nationwide to become the 43rd President of the United States.
